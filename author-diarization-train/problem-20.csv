Technology has continuously changed in cartography in order to meet the latest demands of new generations of map users and mapmakers. ",2780,156,0

Map symbology
",4427,91,0
The quality of a map affects the ability of its readers to extract information and also to learn from the map. ,4442,111,0

"At the same time, the color is equally important. How a cartographer displays the entire data with the help of different hues can considerably affect the understanding as well as the feel of the map. ",5405,200,0

"Map types General vs themati c cartography
In order to understand the ba sics of maps, the field of cartography may be divided into two categories. ",6409,148,0
These are thematic cartography and general cartography. General cartography deals with those maps that have been made for a general audience and thus they contain various features. ,6515,181,0
"General maps exhibit a number of reference as well as location systems and these are generally are produced in a series.

"For example, a dot map showing the production of corn in Indiana. As the quantity of geographic data has actually exploded during the last century, the concept of thematic cartography has become quite useful in interpretation of spatial, cultural as well as social data.
",6886,271,0
A thematic map is used to di splay spatial pattern of a particular theme or series of attributes. ,7885,98,1
"As compared to the reference maps which show a number of geographic features like forests, roads and political boundaries, the thematic maps always emphasize sp atial variation of just one or a very small number of geographic distributions. ",7984,241,1
Such distributions may be physical phenomena like climate or human characteristics that may include health issues and population density . ,8226,139,1
These maps are sometimes referred as graphic essays which portray spatial variations as well as interrelationships of various geographical distributions. ,8366,154,1
"Location is important in order to provide a reference base. While general reference maps depict where a particular is in space, the thematic maps can tell a story about that particular place.
",8521,192,1
Choropleth maps are those thematic maps that are used to portray various data collection areas like census tracts or counties with color. ,8712,138,0

"Topographic Maps vs Topological Maps
A topograp hic map is mainly concerned with topographic description of a particular place, including the use of contour lines that show elevation. ",9133,184,0
"Terrain or relief may be shown in various ways.
A topological m ap is a general type of map and it generally disregards scale and other details and offers clarity of communicating any specific route or information. ",9281,215,0
"An iconic example of this case is Beck's London Underground map. Although it is the most commonly used map of ""The Tube,"" but it preserves little reality. ",9449,155,0
"It varies the true scale constantly as well as abruptly, it also straightens the curved tracks and at the same time it contorts directions haphazardly. ",9540,152,0
"As a matter of fact, the only traits that are preserved by the map are the sequence of different stations, crossings along the tracks and the fact whether a particular station or crossing is located on the north or south of the Thames River. ",9693,242,0
"As a matter of fact, those are all the details that a typical passenger wants to know and as a result, so the map fulfills its purpose.
",9936,136,0
One area that has evolved a specific and recognizable variation in maps is that which is used by public transport organisations for guiding passengers on urban rail and metro maps. ,10073,181,0
"Most of them are loosely based on 45 degree angles that was originally perfected by Harry Beck and George Dow.

"Google Earth and Google Maps are both location based tools but the basic difference between them is that Google Maps is an online tool and on the other hand, Google Earth is basically a stand-alone application that has to be downloaded. ",10512,237,1
"Google Earth was released in the year 2005 and it makes use of satellite images along with aerial photographs and on the other hand, Google Maps makes use of only satellite images.
