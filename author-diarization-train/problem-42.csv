"If the order the postulateswere listed in the Elements is significant, it indicates thatEuclid included this postulate only when he realised he could notprove it or proceed without it.

"Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen)(965-1039), an Iraqi mathematician, made the first attempt atproving the parallel postulate using a proof by contradiction,where he introduced the concept of motion and transformation intogeometry. ",435,222,0

"Unlike many commentators on Euclidbefore and after him (including Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri),Khayyam was not trying to prove the parallel postulate as such butto derive it from an equivalent postulate: ""Two convergent straightlines intersect and it is impossible for two convergent straightlines to diverge in the direction in which they converge.""

"If those equal internal angles are right angles, weget Euclid's Fifth; otherwise, they must be either acute or obtuse.",1777,118,0
"He persuaded himself that the acute and obtuse cases lead tocontradiction, but had made a tacit assumption equivalent to thefifth to get there.

"Girolamo Saccheri (1667-1733) pursued thesame line of reasoning more thoroughly, correctly obtainingabsurdity from the obtuse case (proceeding, like Euclid, from theimplicit assumption that lines can be extended indefinitely andhave infinite length), but failing to debunk the acute case(although he managed to wrongly persuade himself that hehad).
