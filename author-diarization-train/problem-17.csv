"What is the Difference Between the GRE and the GMAT?
On the surface, the biggest difference between the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) and the GMAT is simply that the GMAT is intended to predict a candidate's suitability for a business and management related graduate program, whereas the GRE is a more general, cross-spectrum test that covers a wide range of different programs: Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Sciences, Science, Literature, English, Mathematics, Physics and Psychology.
